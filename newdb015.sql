The first is the short story &lsquo;The Brave Little Goat of Monsier S&eacute;guin&rsquo;, written by French author Alphonse Daudet and illustrated by <a href="index.php?option=com_publications&view=creator&cid=chiyoko_nakatani&Itemid=11">Chiyoko Nakatani</a>. Beautiful illustrations tell the tale of how a goat which has escaped from its master bravely fights a wolf that it meets on a mountain. The second volume is &lsquo;Dumpling Soup&rsquo;, a heart-warming story published in 1997 about an old man who has lost his wife, and thinks of her as he remembers the dumpling soup which she always made, finally treating a large group of his friends to dumpling soup that he himself made. The illustrations are those of Paris-dwelling artist Satomi Ichikawa, who is active in France and America.</p>\r\n            <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="430">\r\n              <tbody>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                  <td valign="top" style="padding-right: 15px;" class="NewsBookDescription"><a href="index.php?option=com_publications&view=title&tid=19&Itemid=37"><img src="images/news/may2008/052008_the_brave_little_goat_b.jpg" alt="The Brave Little Goat of Monsier S&eacute;guin" style="margin-bottom: 5px;" class="KeyLine" height="255" width="199" /></a><span class="NewsBookTitle">The Brave Little Goat of Monsier S&eacute;guin</span><br />\r\n                    by Alphonse Daudet <br />\r\n                    translated and adapted by Eriko Kishida <br />\r\n                    illus. by Chiyoko Nakatani</td>\r\n                  <td valign="top" style="padding-right: 15px;" class="NewsBookDescription"><a href="index.php?option=com_publications&view=title&tid=115&Itemid=37"><img src="images/news/may2008/052008_dumpling_soup_b.jpg" alt="Dumpling Soup" style="margin-bottom: 5px;" class="KeyLine" height="255" width="199" /></a><span class="NewsBookTitle">Dumpling Soup</span><br />\r\n                    by Eiko Kadono <br />\r\n                    illus. by Satomi Ichikawa</td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n              </tbody>\r\n            </table>', '', 1, 1, 0, 1, '2008-05-01 19:13:09', 62, '', '2008-11-20 09:56:05', 62, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2008-09-26 19:13:09', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '', '', 'show_title=\nlink_titles=\nshow_intro=\nshow_section=\nlink_section=\nshow_category=\nlink_category=\nshow_vote=\nshow_author=\nshow_create_date=\nshow_modify_date=\nshow_pdf_icon=\nshow_print_icon=\nshow_email_icon=\nlanguage=\nkeyref=\nreadmore=', 5, 0, 33, '', '', 0, 177, 'robots=\nauthor='),

Children are invited to nominate their favourite books, and shortlists are drawn up for each category in June. Children are then invited to read the shortlisted books over the summer holidays, and a vote is held in September, at the beginning of the new term, to determine the winning books. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Children aged between 6 and 12 (first to sixth year elementary school children) are eligible to vote in the picture book category. ‘A House of 100 Stories’ was the outright winner, claiming around a third of all votes.

The photographer spends time with the child and his or her family, gathering images of everyday life, such as going to school, traditional events, and leisure time. The text, written by the photographer, is carefully crafted in simple language to accompany the photography and paint its own vivid picture of the life of the child, wherever he or she may be. To the end of each volume, the history, politics, industry and other key facts of the featured country are introduced, to encourage greater understanding. </p>\r\n<p>The spread of the internet has globalised our world, making it so much smaller and bringing people much closer together. Still, however, the ordinary lives of children in other countries are often unfamiliar, even unknown, to us. This series presents the everyday joy that is present in the lives of children all over the world. </p>\r\n<p>The photographers taking part in this series include multiple-award winning photojournalists who have spent many years living with and photographing their subjects, as well as young artists using photography as their chosen medium. </p>\r\n<p>The series as it is currently planned is outlined below—is your country included? This series is a wonderful opportunity to travel the world through the eyes of its children. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Series One: 12 volumes</b></p>\r\n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:0px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/nonfiction/title/893.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/01_romania.jpg" alt="romania" width="120" height="141" class="KeyLine"></a><p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW!

Two sequels to the equally well-known "<a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/picture/title/875.html" target="_self">School for Robber</a>" have now reached the 100,000 copies mark. </p>\r\n<p>Many of these copies have been sold to parents who enjoyed reading the original stories when they were young, and now, as grown-ups, which to read them to their own children. Both the original series and this series of sequels have enjoyed widespread acclaim from a diverse range of readers. </p>\r\n<p>Each of the following stories is a sequel to an original story from forty years ago. Of course, all the characters have grown a little older, but that hasn''t stopped them having the sort of crazy adventures that will make readers of all ages smile. </p>\r\n<p>Together, these twenty books form a wonderful set of stories that has a unique charm across many generations. </p>\r\n\r\n<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:0px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/919.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_new_papipupepo.jpg" width="120" height="148" border="0" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n      <p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW! </span><span class="NewsBookTitle">Piggies Playing Music</span>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:10px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/920.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_new_ant.jpg" width="120" height="148" border="0" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n      <p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW! </span><span class="NewsBookTitle">Red Ant Adventure</span>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:10px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/914.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_new_tadpols.jpg" width="120" height="148" border="0" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n      <p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW! </span><span class="NewsBookTitle">Tadpole Elementary School </span>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:10px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/915.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_new_mary.jpg" width="120" height="148" border="0" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n      <p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW! </span><span class="NewsBookTitle">A Shopping Trip with Mary Blue Eyes </span>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="90" style="padding-left:0px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/picture/title/889.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_papipupepo.jpg" width="90" class="KeyLine"></a><p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="NewsBookTitle">Piggies Planting Carrots</span>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="90" style="padding-left:10px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/picture/title/890.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_ant.jpg" width="90" border="0" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n      <p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="NewsBookTitle">Red Ants and Black Ants</span>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="90" style="padding-left:10px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/picture/title/119.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_tadpols.jpg" width="90" class="KeyLine"></a><p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="NewsBookTitle">Tadpole Number 101</span>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="90" style="padding-left:10px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/picture/title/891.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/feb2014/kako_mary.jpg" width="90" border="0" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n      <p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="NewsBookTitle">Blue Eyes, Black Eyes, Brown Eyes</span>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class="TopItem"><a name="news03" id="news03"></a>\r\nDiscover a Captivating New Fantasy World!</h2>\r\n<p class="Date">February 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three volumes of a new fantasy series, "Maya of the Golden Moon", have been published.

One morning, she encounters a mysterious black cat, who leads her to Shadowin, the world of shadows that exists in parallel to the human world. In Shadowin, all things are made from spirits, known as “elma”, and everything is controlled by magicians known as “elmanio”. Those in Shadowin believe Maya to be the Black Elmanio, told of in Shadowin folktales as a saviour who would appear from the human world. Only the Black Elmanio can appease the dark elma whose power threatens Shadowin, and save the world from peril! </p>\r\n<p>Author <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/author/yosuke_tamori.html" target="_self">Yosuke Tamori</a> and illustrator <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/author/atsuko_fukushima.html" target="_self">Atsuko Fukushima</a> have created a vast world filled with unique characters.

The series covered countries as diverse as the Thailand, Peru, and the United Kingdom. Each volume features photography and text focused on one child living with a family resident in the featured country. To create these unique books, the photographer spends time with the child and his or her family, gathering images of everyday life, such as going to school, traditional events, and leisure time. The text, written by the photographer, is carefully crafted in simple language to accompany the photography and paint its own vivid picture of the life of the child, wherever he or she may be. Each volume also gives a brief overview of the history, politics, and industry of the featured country. <br />\r\n  The internet has made even the furthermost corners of the world accessible, but in many cases we still know nothing about the lives of ordinary children in other countries. This series presents the everyday joy that is present in the lives of children all over the world, through the lenses of award-winning photojournalists and artists. </p>\r\n\r\n  <p><strong>Series One: 12 volumes </strong>(published in 2014)<br />\r\n  1: Romania / 2: Republic of Korea / 3: Brazil / 4: Finland / 5: Mongolia / 6: United States of America / 7: Nepal / 8: Kenya / 9: Bangladesh / 10: France / 11: Vietnam / 12: Cambodia <br /><br />\r\n  <strong>Series Two: 12 volumes</strong> (published 2014/15)<br />\r\n  13: Mexico/ 14: Republic of South Africa/ 15: Thailand/ 16: Peru/ 17: Israel/ 18: Palestine/ 19: India/ 20: The Philippines/ 21: Bhutan/ 22: China/ 23: United Kingdom/ 24: Turkey </p>\r\n\r\n  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:0px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/nonfiction/title/944.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/201502/wf_13.jpg" alt="mexico" width="118" height="141" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n        <p> <span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW!

She begins to make her way down through the stories of the house, searching for her clothes and her accessories. But the octopuses and dolphins and all the other sea creatures living in the house already seem to have found good uses for Ten’s things….whatever will she do? \r\n</p>\r\n<p>As with the other books, each story is illustrated in enchanting detail, meaning that there is much to capture the attention of little readers every time they open the book. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:0px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/935.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/august2014/100stories1.jpg" alt="undersea house cover" width="128" class="KeyLine"></a><span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW! </span><span class="NewsBookTitle">An Undersea House of 100 Stories</span></br>by Toshio Iwai\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:10px"><img src="images/news/august2014/100stories2.jpg" alt="undersea house text1" width="195" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="120" style="padding-left:10px"><img src="images/news/august2014/100stories3.jpg" alt="undersea house text2" width="195" class="KeyLine"></a>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class="TopItem"><a name="news02" id="news02"></a>\r\nNew Taro Gomi Book Published </h2>\r\n<p class="Date">August 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest work from <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/author/taro_gomi.html" target="_self">Taro Gomi</a>, <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/936.html" target="_self">The Shadow Plane</a>, is now available to buy. <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/author/taro_gomi.html" target="_self">Taro Gomi</a> is much loved for his playful picture books, charming word play, and his ability to engage young and old minds alike with his games and guides.

A little boy boards the shadow plane, which flies underneath the plane flying peacefully through the sky. He is soon joined by all the different people and animals over which the shadow plane flies. Both planes glide over the ocean to their final destination. And when they land and the plane doors open, there’s a very Gomi-esque ending to the book, filled with humour. </p>\r\n\r\n<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="176" style="padding-left:0px"><a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/newpublications/newpicture/title/936.html" target="_self"><img src="images/news/august2014/kage1.jpg" alt="classmates1" height="176" class="KeyLine"></a><p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"><span class="New">NEW! </span><span class="NewsBookTitle">The Shadow Plane</span></br>by Taro Gomi\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td valign="top" width="176" style="padding-left:0px"><img src="images/news/august2014/kage2.jpg" alt="classmates2" height="176" class="KeyLine"></a><p>\r\n<span class="NewsBookDescription"></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class="TopItem"><a name="news03" id="news03"></a>\r\nMoribito: Guardian of the Spirit</h2>\r\n<p class="Date">August 2014</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh from winning the Author’s Award at the 2014 Hans Christian Andersen Awards, <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/author/nahoko_uehashi.html" target="_self">Nahoko Uehashi</a> will now see her popular fantasy series, <a href="http://www.kaiseisha.net/backlist/fiction/title/479.html" target="_self">Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit</a>, adapted into a live-action drama.
